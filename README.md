# CFront
## What is CFront?
CFront is an open-source framework to use `C programming language` in web development.
This is made possible with `emscripten WASM compiler`.
### Installation
To install CFront and use it you need these programs/tools to be installed:
- Text editor
- Web browser (except internet explorer)
- Emscripten
- git
- python3 and SimpleHTTPServer

After this you just have to run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cMardc/CFront.git
cd CFront
```

See more at [Installation.md](docs/Installation.md).

### Usage
The installed directory `CFront` will probably look like this:
``` bash
$ ls
build  compile.sh  docs  examples  inc	public	src
```
The needed header file will be located at `CFront/inc/frontend.h`.
With this file included you can easily use `C` in `Web development`.

See more at [Usage.md](docs/Usage.md).
